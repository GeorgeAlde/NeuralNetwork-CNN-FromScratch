BasicNetwork:
This is a simple neural network created from scratch in python, based on mean squared error and stochastic gradient descent. It uses partial derivatives to predict the change in loss if a weight or bias was changed and uses this to train the network.
The network's capabilites are demonstrated by a small dataset of weights and heights to predict gender.
